# Rating-Prediction
This repository contains a simple collaborative filtering recommendation system implemented in C++. The system uses either cosine similarity or Pearson correlation to predict user-item ratings based on training data. The predictions are evaluated on a test dataset, and the results are written to an output file.

## Features

- Collaborative filtering based on either cosine similarity or Pearson correlation.
- Input from "train.csv" for training data and "test.csv" for test data.
- Predictions are made for each user-item pair in the test data.
